# Music-as-Gameplay

Music can be used in several ways. It can be used to express emotions, for pure entertainment... How about being used as a part of an entire game?

The project that I want to show you is an example of it. The objective of the player is to avoid certain elements of the scene that are controlled by some information that a simple background music can provide us such as, for example, frequency.

For achieving it, some audio processing techniques including Fast Fourier Transform has been used. It has been developed in C# with Unity as the engine of the game.

Music from: NoCopyrightSounds(NCS).

Unity Version: 5.4.3f1
